## Potato Disease Classification

### Problem Statement:
Farmers who grow potatoes are facing lot of economic losses every year because of various diseases that can happen to a potato plant. There are two common diseases known as early blight and late blight early blight is caused by a fungus and late blight is caused by a specific microorganism and if a farmer can detect these diseases early and apply appropriate treatment then it can save lot of waste
and prevent the economic loss. The treatments for early blight and late
blight are little different so it's important that you accurately identify what kind of disease is there in that potato plant. 

## Possible Solution :
## 1. Create a  streamlit web app which can detect  early blight and late
blight or healthy
